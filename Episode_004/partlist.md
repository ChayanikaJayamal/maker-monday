### 1x ESP32 raw module with breakout Board
You will need a Raw ESP 32 Module. It's a lot easier if you solder it to a breakout Board. So Buy a ESP 32 with Breakout Board. 
Don't buy a ESP 32 DEV module. These have voltage regulators and other stuff on Board which consume a lot of energy! Hint: If it has a USB Port.... it's the wrong one ;) 
### 1x BME280 temperature Sensor
### 2x 4.7 kOhm resistor
### 1x 10 µF capacitor
Used for the ESP32
### 1x 0.1 µF capacitor
Used for the BME280
### 1x 18650 LiFePo4 Battery
Use a LiFePo4 Battery. These are special because of the Voltage of 3.2v

Do not use a typical 3.6V LiIon Cell. It may kill your ESP.
### 1x 18650 Battery tray
### 1x PCB
