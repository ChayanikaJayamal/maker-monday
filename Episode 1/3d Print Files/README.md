# Raspberry Pi3 Paessler Case

This case is a remake from this one: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2316706
Big thanks for this great Job :) 

**This case comes with absolutely no warranty!**

If you want to use the GPIO Pins this case may not fit your needs! If you wan't your own Paessler RPI Case with usable GPIO Pins, feel free to make a feature request ;)

I've printed with PETG to get a bit more flex and a  easy snap in case. PLA should work too. 

My Settiungs:

**Resolution:** 0.2 mm
**Infill:** 20%
**Support:** No
